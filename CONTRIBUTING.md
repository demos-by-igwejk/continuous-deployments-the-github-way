# Contributing

Please keep the [issue tracker](https://github.com/demos-by-igwejk/continuous-deployments-the-github-way/issues) limited to **bug reports** and **improvements**.

## General Questions and Support

If you have questions about how to use reveal.js the best place to ask is in the [Discussions](https://github.com/demos-by-igwejk/continuous-deployments-the-github-way/discussions). Anything that isn't a bug report should be posted as a discussion instead.

## Pull Requests

- Should be submitted from a feature/topic branch (not your `main`)
- Should follow the coding style of the file you work in, most importantly:
  - 4-spaces to indent
  - Double-quoted strings
