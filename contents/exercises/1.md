# :fontawesome-solid-flask-vial: Familiarization with the Workshop Project

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 MD046 -->
The workshop project is composed of two repositories.

- [**`continuous-deployments-the-github-way`**](https://github.com/demos-by-igwejk/continuous-deployments-the-github-way){target="\_blank"}
- [**`platform-library-workflows`**](https://github.com/demos-by-igwejk/platform-library-workflows){target="\_blank"}

Between both repositories, there are two categories of workflows we will leverage.

- Application developer workflows
- Platform engineering workflows

{==

As we explore the project we will give special focus to the highlighted sections of the sources.

## **`continuous-deployments-the-github-way`**

This repository models an the code base for application development.

    1. When you work in a codespace, the environment you are working in is created using a development container, or dev container, hosted on a virtual machine. The configuration files for a dev container are contained in a `.devcontainer` directory in your repository. See "[Introduction to dev containers](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers#creating-a-custom-dev-container-configuration)."


    2. Dependabot takes the effort out of maintaining your dependencies. You can use it to ensure that your repository automatically keeps up with the latest releases of the packages and applications it depends on. For information on the supported repositories and ecosystems, see "[Dependabot supported ecosystems and repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/dependabot/ecosystems-supported-by-dependabot/supported-ecosystems-and-repositories)." You enable Dependabot version updates by checking a dependabot.yml configuration file into your repository.
    3. Dependency review helps you understand dependency changes and the security impact of these changes at every pull request. It provides an easily understandable visualization of dependency changes with a rich diff on the "Files Changed" tab of a pull request. Dependency review informs you of:

         - Which dependencies were added, removed, or updated, along with the release dates.
         - How many projects use these components.
         - Vulnerability data for these dependencies.

         For more information, see "[About dependency review](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-dependency-review)" and "[Reviewing dependency changes in a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-dependency-changes-in-a-pull-request)."
    4. See "[Automatically generated release notes](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes)."
    5. GitHub Actions workflows can automate tasks throughout the software development lifecycle.
    6. The application source code.
    7. Bicep supports an optional configuration file named bicepconfig.json. Within this file, you can add values that customize your Bicep development experience. See "[Configure your Bicep environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/bicep-config)."
    8. The infrastructure resources template.

```

## **`platform-library-workflows`**

This repository models the code base for platform engineering. In addition to providing standardization over the build and deploymnet processes in the organization, it also ensures governance of the process.
